## Process ##

1. Install ZipKin and have it up and running
2. Install Scribe and have it up and running
3. Feed false data to Scribe, to see if Scribe SpanReciever inside ZipKin picks up data from Scribe.
4. On validationing above 3 steps. Replace false data generation layer with python varnish logger.


# Tracking Micro-Services via Varnish Cache #

## Scope ##

Track timing of micro-service requests by passing micro-service requests through a varnish server.


## Varnish Log Script ##

For now the script merely checks and prints varnish log headers (key: value pairs).

Running the varnish logger script.

> &gt; cd log-reader

> &gt; python sample_varnishlog.py

## Installing or configuring jdk. ##

1. Download the jdk from: [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
2. Create a folder "java" inside user home (e.g. /home/[username])
3. mv jdk from ~/Downloads to ~/java
4. extract jdk using tar zxvf **jdk-archive-name.tar.gz**
5. Use command > **update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /home/[username]/java/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/java 1000** Note: name or path to jdk can vary depending on downloaded version.
6. choose default java version using > **update-alternatives --config java**
7. Similarly configure javac, > **update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /home/[username]/java/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/javac 1000**
8. If needed configure default javac using, **update-alternatives --config javac**


## Scribe ##

Scribe is a server for aggregating log data streamed in real time from a large number of servers.

1. git clone git@github.com:traviscrawford/scribe.git
2. 

## ZipKin ##

Running zipkin.

1. git clone git@github.com:twitter/zipkin.git
2. cd zipkin
3. run zipkind example using > **./bin/sbt "zipkin-example/run -zipkin.storage.anormdb.install=true -genSampleTraces=true"**
4. Once zipkin is installed and running, you can view the UI on: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
5. It is loaded with example data, and sqlite in memory database store.

## UI ##

Zipkin UI will be utilized for tracing request paths. UI can be accessed on: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

#### Request Tracking ####

- Trace 
  
  Represents a request path, contains one or more spans.

  - Span represents an RPC. It has,
  
    - **spanId** representing itself. 
    - **parentId** representing parent spanId. Absense means it's the rootSpan. A point from where trace starts.
    - **traceId** linking it to the trace.
    - one or more **annotations**
    
    - Annotation
      - Marks an occurance in time.
        - cs = time when client made the request.
        - sr = time when server recieved the request.
        - ss = time when server sent the response.
        - cr = time when client recieved the response.
        
        cs -> sr -> ss -> cr

        - cr marks the end of an RPC call.
      
      - **Binary Annotations** are time independent and provides extra information about an RPC.
      
Each of the id's are randomly generated and are 64-bits long. **traceId** is only generated once and can be the same as the initial **spanId**. 

On the same RPC **spanId** is re-used during cs / sr / ss / cr (see above). 

Making RPC call downstream will require a newly generated **spanId**. Each downstream call made will have a **spanId** from the RPC caller, it's called **parentId**

Each downstream RPC call will inherit **spanId** RPC call initiater.

Additional headers e.g. **Sampled** value either 0 or 1 is passed. **Sampled** allows RPC call to determine if it should record trace information (1) or not (0). Pre-assuming the flag values, 1 and 0 as yes and no.


#### Collecting Data ####

SpanReciever daemon inside ZipKin is responsible for collecting data, validating it and passing it to storage.

ZipKin has a Scribe reciever. [Scribe](https://github.com/facebookarchive/scribe) is a framework for aggregating log data.

#### Solution Process ####

Idea would be to send all data to Scribe. Then use Scribe SpanReciever inside ZipKin to collection all tracing data and log information.
