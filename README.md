## Solution Steps ##

1. Install ZipKin and have it up and running
2. Feed false data to mysqlite database.
3. Replace false data generation layer with python varnish logger.


## Tracking Micro-Services via Varnish Cache ##

Running ``./script.sh`` should start a web-server on port 8080

Track timing of micro-service requests by passing micro-service requests through a varnish server.

Varnish Cache would run on port **6081** by default. The default.vcl file connects to port **8080** for backend requests. Modify default.vcl file to ``return (pass);`` from vcl_recv sub routine.

    * [Bash Script](script.sh)
     * be sure to change chmod +x script.sh, so you can run it as ``$> ./script.sh``
     * use ``$> terminate=1 ./script.sh`` to only terminate services. It will exit without creating any new services.
