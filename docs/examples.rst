This section will provide a short example on how to extend an endpoint in order for Zipnish to be aware of it.

Full example code found here:
https://github.com/varnish/zipnish/blob/master/logreader/test/server.py

Zipnish requires three headers to be available per request basis:

  * X-Varnish_          - Request id assigned by Varnish.
  * X-Varnish-Trace     - The id that has been assigned by Varnish to the first incoming request.
  * X-Varnish-Parent    - The id of the parent request which has triggered the current request.

.. _X-Varnish: https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/2.1/faq/http.html

.. code-block:: python

    def do_GET(self):
        x_varnish_header = self.headers['x-varnish']
        trace_header = x_varnish_header

        if 'x-varnish-trace' in self.headers:
            trace_header = self.headers['x-varnish-trace']

        headers = {'x-varnish-trace': trace_header,
                   'x-varnish-parent': x_varnish_header}
    ...

In this specific example there is a very simple web server that handles basic GET requests based on a configuration found in server.yaml:

.. code-block:: yaml

  ---
  traces:
      - trace:
          - url: /api/articles
          - span: /api/auth
          - span: /api/titles
          - span: /api/images
          - span: /api/correct
          - span: /api/compose

The test server is exposed through port 9999, our vcl configuration has a backend the points to this server:

.. code-block:: sh
    
    vcl 4.0;

    backend default {
        .host = "127.0.0.1";
        .port = "9999";
    }

    # For simplicity reason disable caching, see vcl how to's for enabled caching.
    sub vcl_recv {
           return (pass);
    }
    
Given that Varnish has its default settings, the request below:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ curl -is http://localhost:6081/api/articles

wil have the following output:

.. code-block:: text

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Server: BaseHTTP/0.3 Python/2.7.9
  Date: Tue, 10 May 2016 08:43:44 GMT
  Content-type: text/html
  X-Varnish: 11
  Age: 0
  Via: 1.1 varnish-v4
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked
  Connection: keep-alive
  Accept-Ranges: bytes

and server output:

.. code-block:: text
  
  127.0.0.1 - - [10/May/2016 08:43:43] "GET /api/auth HTTP/1.1" 200 -
  127.0.0.1 - - [10/May/2016 08:43:43] "GET /api/titles HTTP/1.1" 200 -
  127.0.0.1 - - [10/May/2016 08:43:44] "GET /api/images HTTP/1.1" 200 -
  127.0.0.1 - - [10/May/2016 08:43:44] "GET /api/correct HTTP/1.1" 200 -
  127.0.0.1 - - [10/May/2016 08:43:44] "GET /api/compose HTTP/1.1" 200 -
  127.0.0.1 - - [10/May/2016 08:43:44] "GET /api/articles HTTP/1.1" 200 -
  
The scenario is as follows:

  1. A client does a request to the test server asking for **/articles**
  
  2. In order to serve **/articles**, subsequent calls are required to other endpoints such as **/auth**, **/titles** ...etc. For demo purposes these subsequent calls are handled by the same server, what is important to notice is that all sub-requests go through Varnish as well. A random sleep time has been added for each request in order to simulate some "hard work".
  
  3. The application server decorates the subsequent requests with the required headers, as shown in the code above.
  
  4. Zipnish-logreader picks up its required data from VSL as these requests go through.
  
  5. While data gets written in the MySql database, Zipnish-UI will be able to represent how requests have been issued and how much time each of them has taken.
