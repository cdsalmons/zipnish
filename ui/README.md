####User interface for log reader.####

<br />
#####Solution Process#####

1. Mimic API calls for ZipKin inside Flask interface.
2. Run the UI without API calls.
3. Connect each API call one by one with Flask interface.

<br />
#####Environment Variables#####

Most of the environment variables specified below are used inside [config.py](config.py)

|  Name 	|  Default 	|  Required 	|  Comments 	|
|---	|---	|:---:	|---	|
| APP_CONFIG  	|  development 	|  no 	|   values: development / testing / production. 	|
| DB_USER  	|   	|  yes 	|  database username 	|
| DB_PASS  	|   	|  yes 	|  database password 	|
| DB_HOST  	|   	|  yes 	|  database host 	|
| DB_PORT  	|   	|  yes 	|  database port 	|
| DB_NAME  	|   	|  yes 	|  database name 	|

<br />
#####Application Server#####

Before you run the app, it is required to set some environment variables as listed above.

Envoirnment variables can be temporarily passed to a running webserver as follows,

`$> APP_CONFIG=development DB_USER=zipkin DB_PASS=kinect DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 DB_PORT=3306 DB_NAME=zipkin python manage.py runserver`

Otherwise you need to setup environment variables separately and run the web server using,

`$> python manage.py runserver`

To run python server on a custom port use the following command,

`$> python manage.py runserver -p [CUSTOM PORT NUMBER]`

Similar to above, the following set of options can be utilized:

| Short  	| Long  	|  Description 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| -?  	|  --help 	|   	|
| -h  	|  --host 	|   HOST	|
| -p  	|  --port 	|   PORT	|
|   	|   	|   	|

<br />
#####Application Shell#####

To run application inside a command line shell using the following.

> **Note:**
> Before running the command below. It's important to set envoirnment variables, as outlined in section under
> Application Server.

`$> python manage.py shell`

With this you will be able to interact with application variables, example: `app`, `db` in application context.

<br />
#####ZipKin/Scala Reference#####

Backend for ZipKin web interface is written using Scala.

It can be found on the following link,

[https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-web/src/main/scala/com/twitter/zipkin/common](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-web/src/main/scala/com/twitter/zipkin/common)


<br />
#####Install bower (if not already installed)#####

[http://bower.io/#install-bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower)


<br />
#####Installing Frontend Dependencies#####

`$> cd ui/resources`

`$> bower install`

to upgrade an existing version of bower use

`$> npm update -g bower`

<br />

#####Compiling CSS Code#####

Go into **src/ui** at the root level [src/ui](../src/ui/)

at the command line:

**Note:** In case you do not have sass, compass, grunt available. Please use the below commands to install them.

These commands will install dependencies at a global level.

`$> npm install -g sass`

`$> npm install -g compass`

`$> npm install -g grunt`

On linux you can try,

`$> npm install -g grunt-cli`

Next you will need to install package level dependencies. Use the following command.

`$> npm install`

Previous command will read [package.json](../src/ui/package.json) and install the required dependencies with the right versions.

To generate the development version of bootstrap.css use,

`$> grunt dev`

Alternatively to generate a distribution version of bootstrap.css use,

`$> grunt dist`

Bootstrap generated using the above commands take into account customizations we have made to the default bootstrap files.

#####System#####

**[app](app/)** directory contains application. Written in flask.

#####Other Important Directories#####

**[static](app/static/)** static resources, viewable by public.
**[templates](app/templates/)** contains html file templates which compatible with [Flask Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/).

<br />
#####Configure Virtual Envoirnment#####

Inside this *ui* directory, run the following command.

`$> virtualenv venv`

This should give us a python virtual envoirnment.

Activate virtual envoirnment for python using,

`$> . venv/bin/activate`

Save current set of python application requirements using,

`$> pip freeze > requirements.txt`

Use the following to install required libraries for application to run,

This will read (-r flag) the requirements.txt file and install the required dependencies.

`$> pip install -r requirements.txt`
